    <h3>Group project - Project Context II</h3>
    <img class = "rect" src = "pages/images/page 6/2.png">
    <p>The focus of this project was to create a game with the theme ‘sustainability’, it was also a collaboration with Utrecht University. Our concept was about social sustainability, specifically, the situation of refugees in Utrecht. The player is a pigeon that flies around the city, collecting stories from the refugees, and publishing those stories, consequently improving the state of the city.</p>
    <p>My role in this project was gameplay designer, technical designer, technical artist and VFX artist.</p>

    <p>For our map, we needed a tool that could paint textures on a plane, and be transparent near the canal. So, I designed a tool that interprets color information from a texture: red, green, blue and alpha, into (same order): texture type, tiling, rotation and transparency.</p>

    <p>We needed a system that could change the color and the detail of the houses on runtime, without having to make individual textures for each change. So, I made a shader that divides the UV’s of the houses into a set number of colors, and added detail by ‘’smoothstepping’ perlin noise.</p>
