    <h3>Group project - Project Hybrid</h3>
    <img class = "rect2" src = "pages/images/page 3/2.jpg">
    <p>Our assignment for this project was to create an interactive installation with both physical and digital components. Our experience was about the journey of ‘Ans’, an elderly woman with a fear of death. The installation contained a projected digital portrait, custom-made interactive controllers and a decorated environment.</p>
    <p>My role in this project was developer / technical artist.</p>

    <p>It was important for the 'chambers' that they appeared to be inside the small portraits that the beamer was projecting on. By using a stencil buffer, I was able to have the chambers appear only through the invisible plane in front of the objects.</p>

    <p>My role in the creation of the portrait was developing the transition effects for the three scales, which can interact with the portrait.</p>
