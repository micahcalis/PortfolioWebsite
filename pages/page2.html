    <h3>Solo project - ISA</h3>
    <p>ISA stands for ‘Individuele Studie Activiteit’ (Individual Study Activity), where the assignment was to spend time developing a skill in an area of interest related to the bachelor. I chose to fully develop a character as a mod for <a href="https://rivalsofaether.com/" target = "blank">Rivals of Aether</a>. This included programming in GameMaker Studio, animating in Aseprite and designing an entire moveset for a character in a 2D platform fighter.</p>
