    <img class = "rect" src = "pages/images/page 5/1.png">
    <p>In this two week course, we were given the assignment of creating an interactive experience about a chosen defense mechanism. We created a short game with the theme of escapism.</p>
    <p>My role in this project was developer, technical designer and technical artist.</p>
